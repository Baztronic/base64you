# base64you
rockyou.txt and tools
## What even is it
A little script I wrote for a CTF that base64-encodes each line of a given text file (I used rockyou.txt). I tried some bash builtins and got about 200 lines a second which isn't really very good, so a python script was born. This managed about 40000 lines a second which is a bit better.
